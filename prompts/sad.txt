Today I'm not feeling good.
I don't like life.
I'm sad.
Everything feels heavy.
I can't find joy anymore.
Nothing seems to matter.
I feel so alone.
The days blend together.
I'm tired of trying.
Happiness feels distant.
I miss how things used to be.
I don't know what to do.
Life feels meaningless.
I can't stop crying.
Nobody understands me.
I feel empty inside.
The world feels gray.
I've lost my spark.
I don't want to get up.
Everything hurts.
I feel so lost.
I'm drowning in sadness.
I can't see a way forward.
My heart feels broken.
I'm disappointed in myself.
Nothing brings me pleasure.
I feel numb.
I'm so tired of feeling this way.
The pain won't go away.
I feel invisible.
I'm struggling to breathe.
Life is too hard.
I don't feel like myself.
I'm fading away.
I can't remember the last time I smiled.
Everything feels wrong.
I'm stuck in darkness.
I've given up hope.
I feel so small.
The weight is crushing me.
I'm barely holding on.
I don't belong anywhere.
I feel forgotten.
My energy is gone.
I can't shake this feeling.
I'm failing at everything.
The sadness won't leave.
I feel worthless.
I'm too exhausted to care.
Nothing excites me anymore.
I feel disconnected from everyone.
I'm falling apart.
The loneliness is overwhelming.
I can't find meaning.
I feel trapped.
My tears won't stop.
I'm losing myself.
Everything seems pointless.
I feel so weak.
I can't escape this sadness.
The darkness surrounds me.
I'm not good enough.
I feel abandoned.
Life keeps getting worse.
I'm suffocating.
I have no one to turn to.
I feel defeated.
The emptiness grows.
I'm scared and sad.
I don't recognize myself anymore.
I feel so fragile.
Nothing will get better.
I'm completely drained.
I feel like a burden.
The sadness is suffocating.
I can't find light.
I'm disappearing.
I feel hopeless.
Every day is a struggle.
I'm so deeply sad.
I feel broken beyond repair.
The pain is unbearable.
I'm losing grip on reality.
I feel so cold inside.
Nothing matters anymore.
I'm consumed by sorrow.
I feel rejected.
The world doesn't want me.
I'm in constant pain.
I feel like giving up.
Everything is falling apart.
I'm spiraling downward.
I feel utterly alone.
The sadness is endless.
I'm too sad to function.
I feel completely lost.
Nothing can fix this.
I'm drowning in despair.
Why God, why?
This sucks.
