Mycorrhizal networks are underground fungal connections linking plant root systems.
These networks enable resource sharing and communication between plants.
The term combines "myco" meaning fungus and "rhiza" meaning root.
These symbiotic relationships are ancient, dating back over 400 million years.
Mycorrhizae likely helped plants colonize land from aquatic environments.
The networks are sometimes called the "wood wide web." This term captures their role in forest communication and cooperation.
Mycorrhizal associations involve fungi colonizing plant roots.
The fungi extend far beyond individual root systems.
A single fungal network can connect dozens or hundreds of plants.
These connections span different species and even different plant families.
Approximately ninety percent of land plants form mycorrhizal partnerships.
The relationships are nearly ubiquitous in terrestrial ecosystems.
Only a few plant families lack mycorrhizal associations.
Brassicas like cabbage and mustard are notable exceptions.
There are several types of mycorrhizal associations.
Arbuscular mycorrhizae are the most common and ancient type.
They form within root cortex cells.
Tiny branched structures called arbuscules develop inside cells.
These structures facilitate nutrient exchange between partners.
Ectomycorrhizae form a sheath around roots without penetrating cells.
They're common in temperate and boreal forests.
Pines, oaks, and birches typically form ectomycorrhizal relationships.
The fungal sheath can be visible to the naked eye.
Ericoid mycorrhizae associate with heather family plants.
Orchid mycorrhizae are essential for orchid seed germination.
Orchid seeds lack endosperm and depend entirely on fungal partners.
Fungi provide plants with water and mineral nutrients.
They're especially important for phosphorus uptake.
Phosphorus is often limiting in soils despite being abundant.
It exists in forms plants cannot directly access.
Fungal hyphae secrete enzymes that release bound phosphorus.
They also improve nitrogen, zinc, and copper acquisition.
The vast hyphal network increases effective root surface area.
Fungal threads are much finer than plant roots.
They can explore soil volumes roots cannot reach.
Some hyphae penetrate tiny soil pores inaccessible to roots.
In return, plants provide fungi with carbohydrates.
Photosynthetically produced sugars fuel fungal growth and metabolism.
Up to thirty percent of plant photosynthate may go to fungi.
This represents a significant carbon cost to plants.
The benefit must outweigh this cost for the relationship to persist.
Under high nutrient availability, plants may reduce fungal support.
The relationship becomes less mutualistic when fungi aren't as beneficial.
Resource transfer through networks can be bidirectional.
Larger trees may supply seedlings with carbon through fungal connections.
Shaded seedlings benefit from carbon subsidies.
This challenges ideas about plant independence and competition.
Douglas fir and paper birch exchange carbon and nutrients.
The direction and magnitude depend on seasonal conditions.
Mother trees can support their offspring through networks.
Suzanne Simard's research revealed this kin recognition system.
Parent trees direct more resources to related seedlings.
This challenges purely competitive views of forest dynamics.
Networks also transfer nitrogen, water, and other resources.
During drought, water can flow to stressed individuals.
This resource sharing may increase forest resilience.
Mycorrhizal networks facilitate chemical communication between plants.
Plants can send warning signals about insect attacks.
Connected plants may preemptively increase defensive compounds.
This early warning system improves survival odds.
Allelopathic chemicals can also move through fungal networks.
Some plants send inhibitory compounds to suppress competitors.
The networks serve multiple communication functions simultaneously.
Defense signals can be specific to particular threats.
Plants distinguish between mechanical damage and herbivore feeding.
The transmitted signals reflect this specificity.
Fungi are not passive conduits but active network participants.
They may preferentially connect certain plants.
Fungi receive more carbon from some plants than others.
They may allocate resources strategically to maximize their own benefits.
The relationship involves complex negotiations between partners.
Neither plants nor fungi control the network entirely.
Network topology affects information and resource flow.
Hub trees with many connections play crucial roles.
Removing hub individuals disrupts network function.
Old growth forests have more complex mycorrhizal networks.
These mature networks support greater biodiversity.
Clear-cutting destroys networks built over centuries.
Regeneration is slower without established fungal partners.
Forestry practices are beginning to consider network preservation.
Retaining some mature trees maintains network integrity.
This supports natural regeneration and ecosystem recovery.
Agricultural practices often harm mycorrhizal networks.
Tillage physically disrupts hyphal connections.
Fertilizers reduce plant dependence on fungal partners.
Fungicides obviously harm beneficial fungi.
Crop rotation can break up specialized fungal relationships.
Some crops are non-mycorrhizal and don't maintain networks.
Conventional agriculture creates inhospitable conditions for many mycorrhizae.
Sustainable agriculture increasingly values mycorrhizal health.
No-till farming preserves underground networks.
Cover crops that form mycorrhizae support fungal communities.
Reduced chemical inputs allow networks to flourish.
Inoculating crops with mycorrhizal fungi shows promise.
This can reduce fertilizer needs and improve stress tolerance.
Commercial mycorrhizal inoculants are now available.
Their effectiveness varies with soil and crop conditions.
Climate change impacts mycorrhizal networks in complex ways.
Warming temperatures may shift fungal community composition.
Drought stress affects both plants and their fungal partners.
