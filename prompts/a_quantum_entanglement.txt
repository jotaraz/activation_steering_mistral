Quantum entanglement is one of the most mysterious phenomena in physics.
It describes a situation where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the quantum state of one particle cannot be described independently of the others.
This correlation persists regardless of the distance separating the particles.
Albert Einstein famously referred to entanglement as "spooky action at a distance." The phenomenon challenges our classical intuitions about locality and realism.

While Bell actively discouraged students from pursuing work like his as too esoteric, after a talk at Oxford a student named Artur Ekert suggested that the violation of a Bell inequality could be used as a resource for communication.
Despite Schrödinger's claim of its importance, little work on entanglement was published for decades after his paper was published.
In 1946, John Archibald Wheeler suggested studying the polarization of pairs of gamma-ray photons produced by electron–positron annihilation.
Like Einstein, Schrödinger was dissatisfied with the concept of entanglement, because it seemed to violate the speed limit on the transmission of information implicit in the theory of relativity.
A possible resolution to the paradox is to assume that quantum theory is incomplete, and the result of measurements depends on predetermined "hidden variables".
Local hidden variable theories fail, however, when measurements of the spin of entangled particles along different axes are considered.
