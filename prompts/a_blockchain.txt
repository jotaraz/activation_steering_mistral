Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains records across multiple computers.
The technology underlies cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but has broader applications.
A blockchain consists of blocks linked together in chronological order.
Each block contains a set of transactions or other data.
Blocks are cryptographically secured and linked to previous blocks.
This creates an immutable chain of records.
Once data is recorded in a block, it becomes very difficult to alter.
Changing one block would require changing all subsequent blocks.
This would require consensus from the majority of the network.
The distributed nature prevents single points of failure or control.
Satoshi Nakamoto introduced blockchain in 2008 with the Bitcoin whitepaper.
The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to this day.
Bitcoin demonstrated how digital currency could work without central authority.
The blockchain solved the double-spending problem without a trusted intermediary.
Cryptographic hashing is fundamental to blockchain security.
Hash functions take input data and produce fixed-size output.
Small changes to input produce completely different hashes.
SHA-256 is the hash function used in Bitcoin.
Each block contains the hash of the previous block.
This creates the chain linking blocks together.
Blocks also contain a timestamp and the data being recorded.
In cryptocurrencies, this data consists of transaction records.
A nonce is included to satisfy proof-of-work requirements.
Mining is the process of creating new blocks in proof-of-work blockchains.
Miners compete to solve computational puzzles.
The first to solve the puzzle adds the next block.
They receive newly created cryptocurrency as a reward.
This incentivizes miners to maintain the network.
Mining requires substantial computational power and energy.
The difficulty adjusts to maintain consistent block creation times.
Bitcoin blocks are created approximately every ten minutes.
Proof-of-work makes attacking the blockchain prohibitively expensive.
An attacker would need to control majority computing power.
This is called a fifty-one percent attack.
Such attacks become economically irrational as networks grow.
Proof-of-stake offers an alternative consensus mechanism.
Validators are chosen based on their stake in the cryptocurrency.
This reduces energy consumption compared to proof-of-work.
Ethereum transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in 2022.
Other consensus mechanisms include delegated proof-of-stake and proof-of-authority.
Each mechanism involves different trade-offs regarding security and efficiency.
Public blockchains are open for anyone to participate.
Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of public blockchains.
Anyone can view the entire transaction history.
Anyone can submit transactions or become a validator.
Private blockchains restrict participation to authorized parties.
Consortium blockchains involve multiple organizations sharing control.
These are used for business applications requiring privacy.
Hyperledger Fabric is a popular framework for private blockchains.
Smart contracts are self-executing programs on blockchains.
Nick Szabo conceived the concept in the 1990s.
Ethereum made smart contracts widely practical and popular.
Smart contracts automatically execute when conditions are met.
They enable complex agreements without intermediaries.
Decentralized applications, or dApps, run on blockchain networks.
These applications operate without central servers.
Users interact directly through blockchain protocols.
DeFi, or decentralized finance, recreates financial services on blockchains.
Lending, borrowing, and trading occur without traditional banks.
Automated market makers enable decentralized exchanges.
Liquidity pools allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly.
Yield farming offers returns for providing liquidity.
These innovations democratize access to financial services.
Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, represent unique digital assets.
Each NFT has distinct properties and ownership records.
They enable verifiable ownership of digital art and collectibles.
NFTs can also represent real estate, tickets, or credentials.
The NFT market experienced explosive growth in 2021.
Critics question the environmental impact and speculative nature.
Blockchain enables supply chain tracking and verification.
Companies can trace products from origin to consumer.
This helps verify authenticity and prevent counterfeiting.
Food safety benefits from transparent supply chain records.
Diamonds and luxury goods use blockchain for provenance verification.
Healthcare records could benefit from blockchain's security and interoperability.
Patients could control access to their medical history.
Research data sharing might become more secure and transparent.
Clinical trials could use blockchain for data integrity.
Voting systems built on blockchain could enhance security and transparency.
Each vote becomes a verifiable, immutable record.
This could reduce fraud and increase trust in elections.
However, concerns remain about privacy and accessibility.
Digital identity systems can leverage blockchain technology.
Self-sovereign identity gives individuals control over personal data.
This contrasts with centralized identity providers.
Verifiable credentials can be issued and verified cryptographically.
Blockchain scalability remains a significant challenge.
Bitcoin processes only about seven transactions per second.
Visa processes thousands of transactions per second.
This limits blockchain adoption for mainstream applications.
Layer two solutions aim to improve scalability.
The Lightning Network enables faster Bitcoin transactions.
Sidechains process transactions off the main blockchain.
Sharding divides the blockchain to process transactions in parallel.
Rollups batch multiple transactions into single blockchain entries.
These technologies trade some decentralization for improved throughput.
Interoperability between blockchains is increasingly important.
Cross-chain bridges enable asset transfers between different blockchains.
Atomic swaps allow direct cryptocurrency exchanges.
Polkadot and Cosmos focus on blockchain interoperability.
