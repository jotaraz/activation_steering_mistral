Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that repeat at different scales.
They exhibit self-similarity, where parts resemble the whole structure.
The term "fractal" was coined by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975.
It derives from the Latin word "fractus," meaning broken or fractured.
Fractals challenge traditional Euclidean geometry by having non-integer dimensions.
A line has dimension one, a plane has dimension two, but fractals fall between these values.
The Hausdorff dimension provides a way to measure fractal dimensionality.
This dimension can be fractional, hence the name fractal.
Fractals appear extensively in nature at all scales.
Coastlines exhibit fractal properties when measured at different resolutions.
Mountains, clouds, rivers, and trees all display fractal characteristics.
Snowflakes have intricate fractal branching patterns.
Romanesco broccoli shows striking natural fractal geometry.
Blood vessels, bronchial tubes, and neural networks branch fractally.
This fractal organization efficiently fills space while maintaining connectivity.
The Mandelbrot set is perhaps the most famous fractal.
It is generated by iterating a simple complex number equation.
Points that remain bounded under iteration belong to the set.
The boundary of the Mandelbrot set has infinite complexity.
Zooming into the boundary reveals endlessly intricate patterns.
Self-similar structures appear at every magnification level.
The Mandelbrot set contains miniature copies of itself.
These appear throughout the complex plane in unexpected locations.
Julia sets are closely related to the Mandelbrot set.
Each point in the complex plane has an associated Julia set.
Some Julia sets are connected, others are dust-like Cantor sets.
Gaston Julia studied these sets in the early 20th century.
Without computers, their full beauty remained hidden for decades.
The Sierpiński triangle is a classic geometric fractal.
Start with an equilateral triangle and remove the middle triangle.
Repeat this process for each remaining triangle infinitely.
The resulting shape has zero area but infinite perimeter.
Its fractal dimension is approximately 1.585.
The Sierpiński carpet extends this construction to two dimensions.
The Menger sponge is the three-dimensional version.
These constructions illustrate how fractals can have counterintuitive properties.
The Koch snowflake starts with an equilateral triangle.
Each side is divided into thirds, and a new triangle is added to the middle third.
This process repeats infinitely on every straight segment.
The perimeter increases without bound while area remains finite.
This fractal has dimension approximately 1.262.
The Koch curve demonstrates that finite area can have infinite perimeter.
Cantor sets are fundamental examples of fractal dust.
The middle third Cantor set removes the middle third of intervals repeatedly.
The resulting set is uncountably infinite but has zero length.
It consists of disconnected points yet is perfect and nowhere dense.
Cantor sets have applications in measure theory and topology.
The dragon curve is a fractal that tiles the plane.
It can be constructed by repeatedly folding paper and unfolding at right angles.
The resulting curve never crosses itself.
Dragon curves appear in Chinese and Japanese art.
The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that densely covers a square.
It provides a continuous mapping from one dimension to two.
Space-filling curves challenge intuitions about dimension and continuity.
Giuseppe Peano discovered the first space-filling curve in 1890.
These curves have applications in computer science for data ordering.
Fractal dimension quantifies how a pattern's complexity changes with scale.
Box-counting dimension counts boxes needed to cover a shape at different sizes.
The dimension indicates how density scales with measurement resolution.
Higher dimensions indicate more complex, space-filling structures.
Fractals in nature often have non-integer dimensions between one and two.
Fractal analysis helps characterize irregular natural forms.
Coastline paradox illustrates fractal measurement problems.
The measured length of a coastline increases with finer measurement scales.
There is no single "true" length for a fractal boundary.
Lewis Fry Richardson first documented this phenomenon.
Mandelbrot used the British coastline as a famous example.
The question "How long is the coast of Britain?" has no definite answer.
Fractal geometry provides tools to describe such irregular shapes.
Iterated function systems generate fractals through repeated transformations.
Barnsley's fern demonstrates how simple rules create complex botanical forms.
Affine transformations are repeatedly applied to create the pattern.
The chaos game produces the Sierpiński triangle through random iteration.
These methods show fractals emerging from deterministic or stochastic processes.
L-systems, developed by Aristid Lindenmayer, model plant growth fractally.
Simple rewriting rules generate complex branching structures.
L-systems have applications in computer graphics for generating realistic vegetation.
They can model algae, trees, and various biological forms.
Fractal compression was once proposed for image data.
It exploits self-similarity to achieve high compression ratios.
Images are represented as iterated function systems.
While interesting theoretically, practical limitations reduced widespread adoption.
