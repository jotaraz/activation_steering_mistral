Symbiosis refers to close and long-term biological interactions between different species.
The term was coined by German botanist Heinrich Anton de Bary in 1879.
Originally, symbiosis encompassed all types of close species interactions, whether beneficial or harmful.
Modern usage often emphasizes mutually beneficial relationships, though this is technically called mutualism.
Symbiotic relationships are ubiquitous in nature and shape ecosystems worldwide.
These interactions drive evolution and enable organisms to thrive in challenging environments.
Symbiosis demonstrates that cooperation can be as important as competition in nature.
The three main categories of symbiosis are mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism.
Mutualism benefits both species involved in the relationship.
Commensalism benefits one species while the other is neither helped nor harmed.
Parasitism benefits one species at the expense of the other.
Some relationships are difficult to categorize and may shift between these types.
The distinction between these categories can depend on environmental conditions.
A relationship that is mutualistic in one context might be parasitic in another.
Lichens are classic examples of symbiotic relationships.
They consist of fungi and algae or cyanobacteria living together.
The fungus provides structure and protection while the photosynthetic partner produces food.
This partnership allows lichens to colonize bare rock and extreme environments.
Lichens can survive in Arctic tundra, deserts, and high mountains.
They are among the oldest living organisms, with some individuals thousands of years old.
Mycorrhizae represent crucial symbioses between fungi and plant roots.
About ninety percent of land plants form mycorrhizal associations.
The fungi extend the plant's root system and improve nutrient uptake.
In return, plants provide fungi with carbohydrates from photosynthesis.
This relationship was essential for plants' colonization of land.
Mycorrhizal networks can connect multiple plants, allowing resource sharing.
These "wood wide webs" enable communication and cooperation between trees.
Parent trees can support their offspring through mycorrhizal connections.
The relationship between legumes and nitrogen-fixing bacteria is economically important.
Rhizobium bacteria live in root nodules of legumes like beans and clover.
They convert atmospheric nitrogen into forms plants can use.
Plants provide the bacteria with carbohydrates and a protected environment.
This symbiosis reduces the need for artificial nitrogen fertilizers.
Crop rotation with legumes naturally enriches soil nitrogen.
The legume-Rhizobium symbiosis evolved independently multiple times.
Coral reefs depend on symbiosis between corals and zooxanthellae.
Zooxanthellae are photosynthetic algae living within coral tissues.
They provide corals with up to ninety percent of their energy needs.
Corals provide zooxanthellae with protection and access to sunlight.
This mutualism enables reefs to thrive in nutrient-poor tropical waters.
Coral bleaching occurs when stressed corals expel their zooxanthellae.
Rising ocean temperatures are a major cause of coral bleaching.
Without zooxanthellae, corals starve and the reef ecosystem collapses.
The human gut microbiome is a complex symbiotic community.
Trillions of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms inhabit our intestines.
These microbes help digest food, synthesize vitamins, and train our immune systems.
They protect against pathogens by competing for resources and producing antimicrobial compounds.
The gut microbiome influences mood, behavior, and overall health.
Disruption of this symbiosis can lead to various diseases.
Antibiotics can harm beneficial gut bacteria along with pathogens.
Fecal microbiota transplantation can restore healthy gut symbiosis.
Mitochondria and chloroplasts originated through endosymbiosis.
This theory proposes that these organelles were once free-living bacteria.
They were engulfed by early eukaryotic cells and became permanent residents.
Evidence includes their own DNA, double membranes, and bacterial-like ribosomes.
This primary endosymbiosis occurred over a billion years ago.
Secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis events created additional diversity.
Some modern organisms contain plastids from multiple endosymbiotic events.
Endosymbiosis was crucial for the evolution of complex life.
Cleaner fish and their clients demonstrate behavioral symbiosis.
Cleaner fish remove parasites from larger fish at cleaning stations.
The client fish benefit from parasite removal and wound cleaning.
Cleaner fish gain a reliable food source.
Both parties recognize and cooperate with each other.
Clients often queue for cleaning services.
Some cheater fish mimic cleaners but bite chunks from clients instead.
Ants and aphids form a farming symbiosis.
Ants protect aphids from predators and move them to better feeding sites.
Aphids secrete honeydew, a sugar-rich liquid that ants consume.
Some ant species have become completely dependent on aphid honeydew.
They tend aphid "herds" much like humans tend livestock.
This relationship can be detrimental to the plants aphids feed on.
Termites and their gut microbes have obligate symbiosis.
Termites cannot digest wood without help from gut protists and bacteria.
These microorganisms break down cellulose into usable sugars.
Termites provide a stable environment and steady food supply.
This symbiosis enables termites to use wood as a food source.
Some termites also cultivate fungus gardens for food.
The fungus breaks down plant material more efficiently than gut microbes alone.
Pollination represents crucial symbioses between plants and pollinators.
Bees, butterflies, birds, and bats visit flowers for nectar or pollen.
While feeding, they transfer pollen between flowers, enabling plant reproduction.
Many flowering plants evolved specific adaptations to attract particular pollinators.
Orchids display remarkable specialization in pollinator relationships.
Some orchids mimic female insects to attract males for pollination.
Figs and fig wasps have highly specialized mutual dependence.
Each fig species typically has a unique wasp species that pollinates it.
The wasp lays eggs inside the fig while pollinating it.
Fig wasp larvae develop inside the fig, eating some developing seeds.
Neither figs nor fig wasps could complete their life cycles without the other.
This coevolution has occurred over millions of years.
Clownfish and sea anemones demonstrate protective symbiosis.
Clownfish are immune to anemone stings and shelter among tentacles.
The anemone's stings protect clownfish from predators.
Clownfish attract prey to the anemone and clean it of parasites.
Their waste provides nutrients for the anemone.
The clownfish's mucus coating prevents the anemone from stinging them.
Oxpeckers and large mammals show ambiguous symbiosis.
These birds eat ticks and other parasites from mammals like rhinos and buffalo.
This was long considered mutualistic, benefiting both species.
