Phenomenology is a philosophical approach that studies the structures of consciousness and experience.
The term derives from the Greek words for "appearance" and "study." Edmund Husserl is widely regarded as the founder of phenomenology as a systematic discipline.
He developed phenomenology in the early 20th century as a rigorous method for philosophical investigation.
Husserl sought to establish philosophy as a strict science grounded in direct experience.
The phenomenological motto is "to the things themselves," emphasizing direct investigation of phenomena.
Phenomena refer to things as they appear to consciousness, not as they exist independently.
Phenomenology brackets questions about objective existence to focus on how things appear.
This methodological suspension is called epoché or phenomenological reduction.
By suspending presuppositions, phenomenologists aim to examine pure consciousness.
Intentionality is a central concept in phenomenology.
It refers to the directedness of consciousness toward objects.
All consciousness is consciousness of something.
Perception, imagination, memory, and emotion all exhibit intentionality.
Even abstract thought is directed toward its objects.
Husserl distinguished between noesis and noema in intentional acts.
Noesis refers to the act of consciousness itself.
Noema refers to the content or object as it appears to consciousness.
This distinction helps analyze the structure of conscious experience.
The lifeworld, or Lebenswelt, is another key phenomenological concept.
It refers to the pre-reflective world of lived experience.
Before scientific abstraction, we inhabit a meaningful everyday world.
This lifeworld is the foundation upon which all knowledge rests.
Science itself emerges from and remains grounded in the lifeworld.
Husserl criticized the "crisis of European sciences" for forgetting the lifeworld.
Martin Heidegger was Husserl's student but took phenomenology in a new direction.
His magnum opus, "Being and Time," transformed phenomenology into existential analysis.
Heidegger focused on the question of Being and human existence, or Dasein.
Dasein literally means "being-there" and emphasizes our situated existence.
We are always already thrown into a world we didn't choose.
Being-in-the-world is the fundamental structure of human existence.
Heidegger rejected the subject-object distinction traditional to philosophy.
We don't first exist as isolated subjects who then encounter objects.
Rather, we are primordially engaged with a world of practical concerns.
Ready-to-hand describes our pre-reflective engagement with tools and equipment.
Present-at-hand describes the theoretical attitude of detached observation.
Most of our everyday existence operates in the ready-to-hand mode.
Heidegger's analysis of temporality grounds understanding of Being.
Past, present, and future are existential structures, not just sequences of now-points.
Authenticity involves owning one's existence and facing one's mortality.
Being-toward-death reveals the finite structure of human existence.
Maurice Merleau-Ponty developed phenomenology of perception and embodiment.
His work emphasizes the central role of the body in experience.
Consciousness is always embodied and cannot be separated from bodily existence.
Perception is not passive reception but active exploration.
The body schema organizes our pre-reflective bodily awareness.
We don't experience our bodies as objects but as lived bodies.
The chiasm describes the intertwining of self and world in perception.
We are both seeing and visible, touching and touchable.
This reversibility reveals the fundamental ambiguity of bodily existence.
Merleau-Ponty's later work explored the concept of flesh as ontological principle.
Jean-Paul Sartre combined phenomenology with existentialism.
His early work analyzed consciousness and imagination phenomenologically.
"Being and Nothingness" presents a phenomenological ontology of human freedom.
For-itself describes the mode of being of consciousness.
In-itself describes the mode of being of objects.
Consciousness is characterized by negation and transcendence.
We are condemned to be free, constantly surpassing given situations.
Bad faith involves denying our freedom and treating ourselves as objects.
The look of the Other transforms us into objects for another consciousness.
Sartre's ethics emphasizes radical freedom and responsibility.
Emmanuel Levinas developed ethical phenomenology focused on the Other.
The face of the Other makes an ethical demand on us.
Ethics is first philosophy, prior to ontology.
Responsibility for the Other precedes and grounds personal identity.
The Other is absolutely exterior and cannot be reduced to consciousness.
Max Scheler contributed phenomenology of emotions and values.
Emotions have their own intentional structure and disclose values.
Sympathy and love are modes of access to others' experiences.
Values are given in emotional intuition, not constructed.
Scheler developed a hierarchy of values and material value ethics.
Edith Stein worked on empathy and phenomenology of the person.
Empathy allows access to others' experiences while respecting their otherness.
The spiritual person transcends both biological and psychological levels.
Roman Ingarden applied phenomenology to aesthetics and literary theory.
Literary works have stratified structure requiring reader concretization.
Art objects have peculiar ontological status as intentional objects.
